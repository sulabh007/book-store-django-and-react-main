        "description": "Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, https: //www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation. The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications. This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well. For a description of standard objects and modules, see library-index. reference-index gives a more formal de\ufb01nition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read extending-index and c-api-index. There are also several books covering Python in depth. This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python's most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language's \ufb02avor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in library-index. The Glossary is also worth going through."

        "description": "This textbook grew out of notes for the ECE143 Programming for Data Analysis class that the author has been teaching at University of California, San Diego, which is a requirement for both graduate and undergraduate degrees in Machine Learning and Data Science. This book is ideal for readers with some Python programming experience. The book covers key language concepts that must be understood to program effectively, especially for data analysis applications. Certain low-level language features are discussed in detail, especially Python memory management and data structures. Using Python effectively means taking advantage of its vast ecosystem. The book discusses Python package management and how to use third-party modules as well as how to structure your own Python modules. The section on object-oriented programming explains features of the language that facilitate common programming patterns. After developing the key Python language features, the book moves on to third-party modules that are foundational for effective data analysis, starting with Numpy. The book develops key Numpy concepts and discusses internal Numpy array data structures and memory usage. Then, the author moves onto Pandas and details its many features for data processing and alignment. Because strong visualizations are important for communicating data analysis, key modules such as Matplotlib are developed in detail, along with web-based options such as Bokeh, Holoviews, Altair, and Plotly. The text is sprinkled with many tricks-of-the-trade that help avoid common pitfalls. The author explains the internal logic embodied in the Python language so that readers can get into the Python mindset and make better design choices in their codes, which is especially helpful for newcomers to both Python and data analysis. To get the most out of this book, open a Python interpreter and type along with the many code samples."

        "description": "This book has been written with two categories of readers in mind. This book can be manual for those who would want to excel in Python programming as well as for those who are new to Python programming and would want to learn. I hope that you will find what follows both instructive and at times entertaining too. The book is designed for programmers who already have some experience of using a modern high level procedural programming language like C/ C++. The book concentrates on the things that are essential to understand Python programming. Those who already know C will find the contents and example code snippets a bit interested. The syntax and coding constructs of Python programming paradigm is nearer to C but not exact. From my point of view, what matters for a programmer is \"Logic\" and \"Syntax\". It has been inevitable for programmers to learn and practice emerging programming paradigms. This is the first edition of the textbook hence a lot of brainstorming was required in order to properly structure each and every chapter. Appendix A addresses exercise questions of \"Python for Everybody\" by Charles R Severance. Appendix B is about Python solution to few commonly found programming problems. All the programs presented in the textbook are tested using PyCharm IDE. I hope the book meets the requirements of student fraternity and remains reachable throughout its multiple entry of editions. Also, PyCharm IDE installation guidelines included in the textbook."

        "description": "\"Havill's problem-driven approach introduces algorithmic concepts in context and motivates students with a wide range of interests and backgrounds.\" -- Janet Davis, Associate Professor and Microsoft Chair of Computer Science, Whitman College \"This book looks really great and takes exactly the approach I think should be used for a CS 1 course. I think it really fills a need in the textbook landscape.\" -- Marie desJardins, Dean of the College of Organizational, Computational, and Information Sciences, Simmons University \"Discovering Computer Science is a refreshing departure from introductory programming texts, offering students a much more sincere introduction to the breadth and complexity of this ever-growing field.\" -- James Deverick, Senior Lecturer, The College of William and Mary \"This unique introduction to the science of computing guides students through broad and universal approaches to problem solving in a variety of contexts and their ultimate implementation as computer programs.\" -- Daniel Kaplan, DeWitt Wallace Professor, Macalester College Discovering Computer Science: Interdisciplinary Problems, Principles, and Python Programming is a problem-oriented introduction to computational problem solving and programming in Python, appropriate for a first course for computer science majors, a more targeted disciplinary computing course or, at a slower pace, any introductory computer science course for a general audience. Realizing that an organization around language features only resonates with a narrow audience, this textbook instead connects programming to students\u2019 prior interests using a range of authentic problems from the natural and social sciences and the digital humanities. The presentation begins with an introduction to the problem-solving process, contextualizing programming as an essential component. Then, as the book progresses, each chapter guides students through solutions to increasingly complex problems, using a spiral approach to introduce Python language features. The text also places programming in the context of fundamental computer science principles, such as abstraction, efficiency, testing, and algorithmic techniques, offering glimpses of topics that are traditionally put off until later courses. This book contains 30 well-developed independent projects that encourage students to explore questions across disciplinary boundaries, over 750 homework exercises, and 300 integrated reflection questions engage students in problem solving and active reading. The accompanying website \u2014 https://www.discoveringcs.net \u2014 includes more advanced content, solutions to selected exercises, sample code and data files, and pointers for further exploration."

        "description": "Based on the latest version of the language, this book offers a self-contained, concise and coherent introduction to programming with Python. The book\u2019s primary focus is on realistic case study applications of Python. Each practical example is accompanied by a brief explanation of the problem-terminology and concepts, followed by necessary program development in Python using its constructs, and simulated testing. Given the open and participatory nature of development, Python has a variety of incorporated data structures, which has made it difficult to present it in a coherent manner. Further, some advanced concepts (super, yield, generator, decorator, etc.) are not easy to explain. The book specially addresses these challenges; starting with a minimal subset of the core, it offers users a step-by-step guide to achieving proficiency."
